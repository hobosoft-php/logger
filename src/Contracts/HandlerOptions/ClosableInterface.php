     * Closing a Handler means flushing all buffers and freeing any open resources/handles.
     *
     * Implementations have to be idempotent (i.e. it should be possible to call close several times without breakage)
     * and ideally handlers should be able to reopen themselves on handle() after they have been closed.
     *
     * This is useful at the end of a request and will be called automatically when the object
     * is destroyed if you extend Monolog\Handler\Handler.
     *
     * If you are thinking of calling this method yourself, most likely you should be
     * calling ResettableInterface::reset instead. Have a look.
